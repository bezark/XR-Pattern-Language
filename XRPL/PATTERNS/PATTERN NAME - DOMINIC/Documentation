Pattern:

How user interface & HUDs are used as a method of storytelling. 
Emotional responses that are evoked from environments that have an uncanny or very similar appearance to reality. Yet something about them feels supernatural or surreal, and how this evokes an uneasy feeling, or in a larger sense any strong emotional response. 
(especially with inspiration drawn from CSGO/valve aesthetic)
